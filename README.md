# odin-recipes
This is my first project in the odin project and it was a demonstration of what can be done with HTML. In this project I used what I learned in the HML section to build a recipe website. Starting with creating a homepage which is the index.html file ensuring it has the boilerplate. Then putting a header and un-ordered list that links(relative link) to recipe pages of foods. In the recipe pages I used a <h1> tag for the header then added an <img> and below the image I used a <h2> tag for the section titles. First section I used <ul> un-ordered list for the ingredients and <ol> ordered list for the second section. Then finally I uploaded my project to GitHub. 

One think I need to improve on and don't understand fully is the <strong>basic Git workflow</strong>.
